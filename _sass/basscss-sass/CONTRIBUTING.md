**The scss files in this repository are not source files.**
They are transpiled from their respective CSS modules using the
[css-scss](https://github.com/jxnblk/css-scss) module.

Do **not** edit the scss files in this repository.

If you've found an issue with the transpiler, file an issue on
[css-scss](https://github.com/jxnblk/css-scss/issues).

If you'd like to make modifications to a Basscss module, first,
open an issue in the module's repository.
Read the [design principles](http://www.basscss.com/docs/reference/principles)
and consider the implications of the change in the larger Basscss ecosystem.
If a change does not follow the design principles, it will not be considered.

Feel free to fix typos and make copy suggestions for the readme, or to
suggest fixes for the build process or tests in this repository.
